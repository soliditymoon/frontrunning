<b>WHAT IS A FRONT RUNNING BOT?</b>
<br><br>
A front-running bot scans pending transactions and pays a more significant gas fee so that miners process its transaction first to front-run a major trade that will affect market pricing.
<br><br>
Bots are pre-programmed programs that allow you to automate your trading. Rather than keeping track of every move in the market and waiting for a good time to buy and sell, the bot will automatically synthesize and assess market data and make asset transactions on behalf of customers. But, how do crypto front-running bots work?
<br><br>
Binance Smart Chain's design permits all submitted transactions to halt in a mempool, where transactions are waiting to be processed. The mempool can be scanned by miners or bots for appropriate transactions to be utilized for front-running in cryptocurrency trading.
<br><br>
Front-runner bots typically work on a millisecond timescale. For example, they may read a transaction from the mempool, compute the optimal transaction size, configure the transactions and then execute them in a fraction of a second. It's impossible to compete when manually operating.
<br><br>
By putting a buy order on the same block and simultaneously setting a higher gas price, the bot front-runs particular slippage, trade volumes and gas price transactions. When additional liquidity is added to an AMM (automated market maker) pool on the exchange, the front-run bot recognizes it and manipulates the order of transactions within a block to profit from another trader.
